    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>  
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
        Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. 
        The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        AI is used in various applications such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and automated customer service. 
        These applications leverage machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
